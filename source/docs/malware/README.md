# Introduction

MacOS has [built-in protection against malware](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/web). 
XProtect scans for malware using a database of virus signatures maintained by Apple, but is limited. Apple is not a 
dedicated security company, and it has not struggled much with malware in the past, leading to 
[two major myths](myths.md). Big Sur is available as a free upgrade, promising the most secure version of macOS.

The biggest threats to a macOS come from potentially unwanted programs, adware, ransomware and other code 
that finds its way onto a Mac because it is bundled with legitimate-looking software or because it was downloaded as 
something else. 

Common signs of Mac malware:

* Extremely slow performance
* A browser homepage change
* Pop-ups and other intrusive ads
* Freeze-up and restarts
* Browser redirection

And if your Mac gets infected with ransomware, it will be pretty obvious. You will get a demand to pay a ransom, and 
will find your files or drives encrypted and impossible to open.  

* If you are worried your machine might be infected, [scan and clean your machine](clean-machine.md).
* You can also [catch and remove daemons and launch agents](daemons-and-agents.md).
