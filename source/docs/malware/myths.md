# Myths

## There are no viruses for Mac

On the contrary: That macOS has been less affected by viruses in the past has resulted in weaker defence mechanisms.
And this myth is exactly what makes macOS attractive for virus creators and social engineers. Trusting users and weakened defences.
 
## Apple quickly fixes vulnerabilities

Nope. In May 2019 Filippo Cavallarin discovered a vulnerability in the Gatekeeper, gave Apple 90 days to fix it, and
having had no response, went public with it [on his blog](https://www.fcvl.net/vulnerabilities/macosx-gatekeeper-bypass). 
Gatekeeper is the tool that prevents unauthorised apps from being installed on a Mac. One would think such a 
vulnerability is worth attention immediately. Accepting mistakes is hard, but when usersâ€™ security is at stake? 

And Filippo Cavallarin was not the first. Independent virus researchers who discover fresh security holes often get 
vague responses from Apple. And even when, the solution take a long time.
