# Turning devices on and off

Depending on your location and context, you may want to turn devices, such as webcam and microphone off and on. Some 
devices can be turned on and off by software, others need blacklisting. Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be 
loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot 
the system. And modules can be blacklisted. 

## Examples

### Turn on/off camera/webcam 

Adversaries can try to gain access with trojans â€“ malware that gives the adversary administrative control over its 
targeted computers, including, in this case, the ability to remotely control webcams. A trojan is an invisibly-installed 
malware program spread via email attachment or by [phishing](attack-trees:docs/social-engineering/Phishing).

Tape the camera. It may even be possible to turn it off in BIOS (depending on your version). Better yet, if you know 
what driver module is controlling the webcam, you can disable the driver with `modprobe -r`.

Check with:
    
    $ lsmod | grep "uvc"

If stuff like this appears, your webcam device uses an [uvc driver](https://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/):

    uvcvideo               79005  0 
    videobuf2_vmalloc      12816  1 uvcvideo
    videobuf2_core         47787  1 uvcvideo
    videodev              126451  3 uvcvideo,v4l2_common,videobuf2_core
    media                  18305  2 uvcvideo,videodev
    usbcore               195340  7 uvcvideo,ums_realtek,usb_storage,ehci_hcd,ehci_pci,usbhid,xhci_hcd

To disable the cam:

    $ sudo modprobe -r uvcvideo 

To enable the cam:

    $ sudo modprobe uvcvideo

If not an uvcvideo driver, try `$ sudo lsmod | grep "media"` and use the `modinfo` command to find out more about the 
modules listed behind it to locate your webcam driver module:

    $ sudo modinfo [modulename] 

Then replace the `uvcvideo` in the above `modprobe` command with the name of your driver module.

To disable the webcam at boot (if file not exists, create it, use your preferred editor):

    $ sudo geany /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

At bottom of the file add this line: `blacklist uvcvideo` (or the name of your driver instead of uvcvideo).

Save the file and reboot. Your webcam is no longer functioning.

### Turn on/off microphone

Use the alsa control panel for muting the microphone:

    $ sudo alsamixer

You can also use the same modprobe enabling/disabling method as used for webcam above. The 
[ALSA modules page](https://alsa.opensrc.org/ALSA_modules) may be helpful for finding your driver module.

### Blacklist firewire and thunderbolt

A direct memory access (DMA) attack is a type of side channel attack in which an adversary penetrates a device by 
exploiting the presence of high-speed expansion ports that permit Direct Memory Access. Firewire, thunderbolt and 
ExpressCard allow (by design) any connecting device full direct memory access to your system. They can be disabled 
in `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-dma.conf` (in debian):

    blacklist firewire-core
    blacklist thunderbolt

The modules will be blacklisted upon reboot.
