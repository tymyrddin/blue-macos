# Secure browsers that protect your privacy

* [DuckDuckGo Desktop browser for MacOS](https://duckduckgo.com/mac) focuses on privacy that is not based on Chromium (as most would expect). Instead it relies on OS-provided rendering engines to build the browser (mostly WebKit). This makes it possible to remove all the unnecessary stuff usually available with popular web browsers.
* [Brave](https://brave.com/) is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It has a built-in ad blocker and browser fingerprinting 
protection, while also giving you access to numerous add-ons and extensions.
* [Ungoogled Chromium browser](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) is an open source project to provide a Chromium browser, without the Google privacy issues.
* [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) is a fork of Firefox focused on privacy, security, and freedom, only available for desktop operating systems.

If the browser you choose is less secure and privacy-friendly, lock down the browser and the software it can invoke.
