# Disable automatic login

It is perhaps annoying to have to enter your password every boot, but it is a little price for
preventing someone getting into your account and accessing your data.

* Go to Apple > System Preferences and click Users & Groups. 
* Click Login Options at the bottom of the list of users on the left.
* Click the lock at the bottom of dialog box and enter your password when prompted. This allows you to make changes to the settings.
* Select Off from the Automatic login dropdown list. 

You will have to enter your password every time you boot your Mac.
