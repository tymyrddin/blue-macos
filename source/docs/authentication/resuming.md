# Require a password when resuming

Password protect your Mac when it goes to sleep or when the screen saver begins.

* Go to Apple > System Preferences and click Security & Privacy. 
* Make sure the General tab is selected.
* Check the Require password box. 
* Select how soon after your Mac goes to sleep, or the screen saver begins. It's a good idea to choose Immediately, especially in a public place, or anywhere there are other people around.

You will be able to wake the computer with your [local password](login.md).
